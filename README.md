# ESP8266_Weather_Info
Arduino Weather Infomation Display


This project was not created by me. I'm a hardware guy and simply repackaged an existing design found at:
http://thisoldgeek.blogspot.ca/2015/01/esp8266-weather-display.html
My changes were to use an Atmega32u4 becuause it has two hardware serial ports and to use a 0.96" oled display.

This repo contains the information needed to create the PCB. Needed to complete the design are:
-oled display  https://github.com/mike-rankin/i2c_oled_3.3v
-plastic arcylic
-4pcs plastic spacers
-4pcs 1/2" 4-40 screws
